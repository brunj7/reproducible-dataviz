## Reproducible Analysis with Rmarkdown

### Dive in: Create our first RMarkdown

Demo time

### Intro Slides

- Why reproducible science
- How Rmarkdown (and friends) can help
  - Combine code and documentation in **one** document/file: literate programming
  - Help to compile compelling documents (reports, journal articles, presentations, ...)
  - Easy to share through various formats (websites, blogs, dashboards, interactive visualizations)
  - Can even let you run other scripting languages (Python, SQL, ...)


- What is Rmarkdown
  - Markdown

- What can you do with Rmarkdown
  - Document extensively your analysis
  - Share results (figures and tables)
  - Let others execute and modify your code
  - Create interactive documents
  - Create websites and blog
  - Write journal articles and Books
- What Rmarkdown can not help you with
  - Data management and access
  - Capture your computing environment
  - Modularize your code

### Hands on exercise

- Use data from LTER
  Potentially: https://nceas.github.io/metajam/articles/dataset-batch-processing.html
- show a compelling data analysis with it
- open the floor to cool data visualizations for the ggplot2 part of the training
